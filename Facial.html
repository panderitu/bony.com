The facial bones comprise the anterior and inferior portion of the skull; they extend essentially from the top of your nose to the bottom of your jaw, or mandible, up and down, and from ear to ear side to side, excluding parts of your eye sockets, or orbits.

        <h3>Mandible</h3>
        <IMG src="mandible female.jpeg">
            <p>
                The mandible is the largest bone in the human skull. It holds the lower teeth in place, it assists in mastication and forms the lower jawline. The mandible is composed of the body and the ramus and is located inferior to the maxilla. The body is a horizontally curved portion that creates the lower jawline.

        <h3>Maxilla</h3>
        <IMG src="maxilla female.jpeg">
            <p>
                The maxilla is the bone that forms your upper jaw. The right and left halves of the maxilla are irregularly shaped bones that fuse together in the middle of the skull, below the nose, in an area known as the intermaxillary suture.

        <h3>Zygomatic</h3>
        <IMG src="zygomatic female.jpeg">
            <p>
                Zygomatic bone, also called cheekbone, or malar bone, diamond-shaped bone below and lateral to the orbit, or eye socket, at the widest part of the cheek. It adjoins the frontal bone at the outer edge of the orbit and the sphenoid and maxilla within the orbit.

        <h3>Lacrimal</h3>
        <IMG src="lacrimal female.jpeg">
            <p>
                There are two lacrimal bones, each of which is located in the medial wall of the orbit; they are hidden behind the nasal bone when looking at the skull from a frontal view. The orbits, or the eye-sockets, are the two bony cavities that enclose the eyeballs, as well as the muscles, blood vessels, and nerves of the eye.
            </P>
                <hr>
        <h3>Nasal</h3>
        <IMG src="nasal female.jpeg">
            <p>
                The nasal bones are two small, symmetrical oblong bones, each having two surfaces and four borders. Positioned in the midface, at their junction, they form the bridge of the nose superiorly and anchor the upper lateral nasal cartilages inferiorly.
                ‌</p>

        <h3>Inferior nasal concha</h3>
        <IMG src="nasal concha.jpeg">
            <p>
                The inferior nasal concha (inferior turbinated bone or inferior turbinal/turbinate) is one of the three paired nasal conchae in the nose. It extends horizontally along the lateral wall of the nasal cavity and consists of a lamina of spongy bone, curled upon itself like a scroll, (turbinate meaning inverted cone).
            </p>
            <hr>
        <h3>Palatine</h3>
        <IMG src="palatine female.jpeg">
            <p>
                The palatine bones are situated at the back of the nasal cavity between the maxilla and the pterygoid process of the sphenoid bone. They contribute to the walls of three cavities: the floor and lateral walls of the nasal cavity, the roof of the mouth, and the floor of the orbits.
            </p>

        <h3>Vomer</h3>
        <IMG src="vomer female.jpeg">
            <p>
                The vomer is a small, thin, plow-shaped, midline bone that occupies and divides the nasal cavity. It articulates inferiorly on the midline with the maxillae and the palatines, superiorly with the sphenoid via its wings, and anterosuperiorly with the ethmoid.

        <p>Skeletal system consists of a framework of bones and a few cartilages. 
            This system has a significant role in movement shown by the body.
            Imagine chewing food without jaw bones and walking around without the limb bones. 
            Bone and cartilage are specialised connective tissues. 
            The former has a very hard matrix due to calcium salts in it and the latter has slightly pliable matrix due to chondroitin salts. 
            In human beings, this system is made up of 206 bones and a few cartilages. 
            It is grouped into two principal divisions - the axial and the appendicular skeleton.</p>
